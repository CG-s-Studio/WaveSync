Random project Notes

* TODOs
** TODO Handle errors which should cause event loop to stop.
** TODO Expand timemark from 2-byte to 3-bytes to cover whole hour
   Use it for warnings if the time seems out of acceptable range (anything over
   1 minute will be unacceptable)
** TODO Add additional frame type with a sender absolute time to do a time sanity check
** TODO Implement packet reordering upon arrival
** TODO Add check for chunk table overflow to fix memleak if pulseaudio hangs
   Happens on native rpi audio card

* Current timemark format
** Create timemark:
  now = current absolute UTC time
  mark = now + latency # Move by latency into the future.
  Now from the absolute time: 2017.02.23 23:14:29.123456:
  Take only seconds and milliseconds (Âµseconds / 1000)
  - Take seconds: 29
  - shift them: 29000
  - add miliseconds: 29123
  This gives range from 0 to 59999 and fits 16 bits.

  Upon reception we might have:

  ------|minute start|-------|now|------|minute end|-------
                                     ^ - TIME MARK WITHIN MINUTE

  Case 1: it falls later within current minute. Assume it's the same minute,
  just later and create an absolute time based on current and timemark.

  --|m start|----|now|----|m end,m+1 start|----
               ^ - TIME MARK WITHIN MINUTE

  Case 2: falls before current time within current minute.
  Assume it's in fact happening in the next minute:

  --|m start|----|now|----|m end,m+1 start|----|m+1 ends|
                                             ^ - ABSOLUTE HERE
